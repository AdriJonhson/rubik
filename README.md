# Rubik Fonts

The Rubik fonts are designed by Philipp Hubert and Sebastian Fischer at http://hubertfischer.com as part of the https://www.chrome.com/cubelab project.

Rubik is a 5 weight Roman + Italic family. 
Rubik Mono One is paired with Rubik One, a proportionally spaced variation of the design.

## New Hebrew character set for the Rubik fonts

This project takes Rubik's original Hebrew designs and tries to improve proportions, spacing and design details related to correct Hebrew type design standards. The Hebrew fork of the project is designed and maintained by Meir Sadan @meirsadan.
