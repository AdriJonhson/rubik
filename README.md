# Rubik Fonts: The Hebrew Fix

The Rubik fonts are originally designed by Philipp Hubert and Sebastian Fischer at http://hubertfischer.com as part of the https://www.chrome.com/cubelab project.

Rubik is a 5 weight Roman + Italic family. 

This project takes Rubik's original Hebrew designs and tries to improve proportions, spacing and design details related to correct Hebrew type design standards. The Hebrew fork of the project is designed and maintained by Meir Sadan @meirsadan.
